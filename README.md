# Libft @ 42 School

Libft is a project at [School 42](https://42abudhabi.ae/), where we create our own library of useful functions in C.

## Overview

This project is aimed at deepening our understanding of the C programming language. Functions developed in this project are analogous to the standard functions in C, and are used in the rest of our projects throughout the School 42 curriculum. 

## Installation & Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/libft.git
cd libft
make
```

This will compile the libft library and create a `libft.a` file. You can then link this library to your own C project files while compiling with gcc or cc.

## Functions

Here are some of the functions I developed for this library:

- `ft_strlen`: A function to calculate the length of a string.
- `ft_strcpy`: A function to copy a string to another string.
- `ft_strcmp`: A function to compare two strings.
- `ft_atoi`: A function to convert a string to an integer.

(Will list all functions later...)

## Bonus Functions

In addition to the basic functions, I also implemented some bonus functions, such as:

- `ft_lstnew`: A function to ...
- `ft_lstmap`: A function to ...
- 
(Will list all functions later...)

## Testing

To test the functions, compile with your files and my libft.a library. For example:

```bash
gcc -L. -lft yourfile.c
```

This will produce a a.out file. Execute it to see the results.

## Contributors
This project was solely developed by myself, but I got help of many very clever friends and students.
